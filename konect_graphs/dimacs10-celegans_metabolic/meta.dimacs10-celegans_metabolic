long-description:  This is the metabolic network of <I>Caenorhabditis elegans</I>.  We acquired the network from the DIMACS10 project, which acquired it from Alex Arena's website, which took it from the article by Jeong et al., which is based on data from the WIT database.  To cite the paper by Jeong and colleagues, which analyses 43 such networks: "This integrated pathway–genome database predicts the existence of a given metabolic pathway on the basis of the annotated genome of an organism combined with firmly established  data  from  the  biochemical  literature.  As  18  of  the  43 genomes deposited in the database are not yet fully sequenced, and a substantial  portion  of  the  identified   open  reading   frames  are functionally unassigned, the list of enzymes, and consequently the list  of  substrates  and  reactions, will certainly be expanded in the future. Nevertheless, this publicly available database represents our best approximation for the metabolic pathways in 43 organisms and provides sufficient data  for  their  unambiguous  statistical  analysis. [...] We first  established  a  graph  theoretic representation of the biochemical reactions taking place in a given metabolic network. In this representation, a metabolic network is built up of nodes, the substrates, that are connected to one another through   links,   which   are   the   actual   metabolic   reactions.   The physical entity of the link is the temporary educt–educt complex itself,  in  which  enzymes  provide  the  catalytic  scaffolds  for  the reactions yielding products, which in turn can become educts for subsequent reactions."
