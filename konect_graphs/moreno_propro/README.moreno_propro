Yeast network, part of the Koblenz Network Collection
===========================================================================

This directory contains the TSV and related files of the moreno_propro network: This undirected network contains protein interactions contained in yeast. Research showed that proteins with a high degree were more important for the surivial of the yeast than others. A node represents a protein and an edge represents a metabolic interaction between two proteins.  The network contains loops.


More information about the network is provided here: 
http://konect.cc/networks/moreno_propro

Files: 
    meta.moreno_propro -- Metadata about the network 
    out.moreno_propro -- The adjacency matrix of the network in whitespace-separated values format, with one edge per line
      The meaning of the columns in out.moreno_propro are: 
        First column: ID of from node 
        Second column: ID of to node
        Third column (if present): weight or multiplicity of edge
        Fourth column (if present):  timestamp of edges Unix time
