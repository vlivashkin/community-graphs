Caenorhabditis elegans (neural) network, part of the Koblenz Network Collection
===========================================================================

This directory contains the TSV and related files of the dimacs10-celegansneural network: This is a weighted directed network representing the neural network of <I>Caenorhabditis elegans</I>.  The original network had directed edges allowing multiple parallel edges with integer weights.  In this version, the network is undirected, allows no multiple edges, and the given edge weights are the sum of the original edge weights.  As described in the original publication by J. G. White and colleagues, the data was assembled by hand and may contain a small number of errors.  To cite:  "We are reasonably confident that the structure that we present is substantially correct and gives a reasonable picture of the organization of the nervous system in a typical <I>C. elegans</I> hermaphrodite."

Files: 
    meta.dimacs10-celegansneural -- Metadata about the network 
    out.dimacs10-celegansneural -- The adjacency matrix of the network in whitespace-separated values format, with one edge per line
      The meaning of the columns in out.dimacs10-celegansneural are: 
        First column: ID of from node 
        Second column: ID of to node
        Third column (if present): weight or multiplicity of edge
        Fourth column (if present):  timestamp of edges Unix time
        Third column: edge weight
